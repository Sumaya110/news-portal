# Simplified version of a News Portal
Design the backend for a simplified version of a news portal following the acceptance
criteria below.


-  Users are registered with their email addresses. No need to build an authentication
system.
-  Users can view all the news publishers subscribed to the portal. Assume
the portal has a fixed set of news publishers subscribed i.e. no need to build how a
publisher subscribes to the portal part.
- News publishers will have a name and some tags denoting the type of news articles
they focus on. For example, the publisher “Daily Journal Corporation” focuses on
“sports”, “politics”, etc.
- Users can search for any publisher with their name or tags. Search results
should be sorted by ascending order of publisher’s name.
- Users can bookmark any news publisher.
- Users can see news articles from all publishers they bookmarked. News articles
should be ordered by descending order of their publish date.
- Assume that a news article consists of a text title, text description and publish date.
